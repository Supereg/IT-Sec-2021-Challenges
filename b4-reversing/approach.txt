So, to our approach. We know we need to get to level 1337 for the flag. Meaning
we need to somehow manipulate the level counter. Also, we have the hint from b6
"Der Gold-ZÃ¤hler wird von unserer Anti-Cheat-Software abgesichert, sodass der Ansatz aus Aufgabe #b4 nicht mehr funktioniert.".

Our approach must be to somehow find the level counter in memory, manipulate it and then somehow get the flag.
The problem description proposes to use a tool like GameConqueror. I complete ignored that, because I don't know that tool.
Instead, following my intuition I used the well known tool "Cheat Engine". It allows use to scan for changing values
to uncover the level counter.

Approach was like follows.
We somehow can rush through level 1 and reach level 2 easily. I always died in level 2 though :(.
So we can control the level counter value to be either 1 or 2.
So this is what I did. Go into the dungeon, search for any ints with a value of `1` with Cheat Engine.
Reach level 2, and we can filter our previous search results for values which are now `2`.
Then we die (because we deliberately do so and not because we are bad or so). Go back to the dungeon and
repeat the Cheat Engine process filtering for `1` again. We repeat this step until there is only one memory address left.
We now try to overwrite this memory address, and viola we can control the level counter in the game.

Now to actually get to the flag we do the following:
1. Enter level 1
2. Pause and set the address to `1336` (it increments to 1337 once we reach the next level)
3. Rush trough level 1 to the exit
4. Now we are in level 1337, somehow - with a lot of trial and error - kill the mobs using those explosion-slimy mobs.
5. Press E on the chest and receive the flag :)

I needed several tires because not dying is actually not that easy :)
