# By looking at the source code we'll notice, that the generateToken function is used twice in index.js. The first time
# to generate the JWT after the login and the second time for generating a download token for the CV.
# The problem is, that the ROLE of the user, who logged in is stored in claims.auth. At the same location the
# second usage of generateToken stores the original filename of the CV file, which is user manipulable.
# The key claims.sub is identical in both cases: the user's email address.
# In preparation of the exploit we'll create a user and upload an empty file named 'admin'
# The exploit works as follows:
#  1) login in the account with the "admin" named CV, and retrieve its JWT login token
#  2) use this token for calling GET "/api/cv" and store the download token
#  3) now use this download token as login token for GET "/api/flag" and celebrate your flag
